# F7-LAS Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the evolution of F7-LAS from **Stage 0 (Foundational Draft)** toward a more complete conceptual and example-driven framework.

---

## 📘 Stage 0 — Current
- Whitepaper published  
- Core model defined (Layers 1–7 + Supplemental Layer S)  
- Repo structure created  
- Initial governance and documentation  
- Placeholder schemas + examples pending  

---

## Stage 1 — Minimum Viable Framework
**Goal:** Basic working examples and schema validations

### Planned:
- Add `/examples` demonstrating simple agent flow  
- Add validated JSON/YAML schemas for tool calls & policy checks  
- Add diagrams for each layer  
- Expand glossary and security rationale  
- Add initial integration patterns  

---

## Stage 2 — Maturing Framework
**Goal:** More robust reference material

### Planned:
- Add multiple agent patterns (Coordinator/Investigator/Remediator)  
- Add more detailed policy-as-code patterns  
- Expand supply-chain security guidance  
- Provide sample telemetry log formats  
- Add mapping to MITRE ATLAS (high level, non-normative)  

---

## Stage 3 — Community Adoption
**Goal:** Broader ecosystem engagement

### Planned:
- Invite community contributions  
- Add reference implementations contributed by others  
- Provide an F7-LAS maturity assessment tool  
- Build alignment examples for enterprise environments  

---

## Long-Term Vision
F7-LAS becomes a widely recognized conceptual framework for **Agentic AI Security**, complementing:

- NIST AI RMF  
- MITRE ATLAS  
- OWASP ASVS  
- MAESTRO  
- AIGN  
- AAM  

This roadmap will evolve based on community feedback.
