# F7-LAS Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the evolution of F7-LAS across clearly defined maturity stages, aligned with the current **Stage 2 — Beta** status described in the README.

---

## Current Maturity — Stage 2 (Beta)

F7-LAS is currently **Stage 2 — Beta**.

**What this means:**
- Layers 1–7 have working *reference implementations and examples (beta quality)*
- Behavioral CI and golden dataset enforcement are present
- The framework is suitable for controlled pilots and evaluation, not production

**Included in Stage 2:**
- System prompts (Layer 1)
- Grounding profile and allowlist (Layer 2)
- Simple planner stub (Layer 3)
- Stub tools and schemas (Layer 4)
- Multi-vendor PDP/PEP examples (OPA, Cedar, Sentinel, Kyverno, SpiceDB) (Layer 5)
- Minimal sandbox boundary (Layer 6)
- Telemetry schema and logger (Layer 7)

---

## Stage 3 — Stable

**Goal:** Production-ready reference patterns

### Planned:
- Full control-to-test traceability
- Expanded golden dataset coverage
- Hardened sandbox and tool isolation examples
- Formal versioning and backward compatibility guarantees
- Enterprise deployment patterns and guidance

---

## Long-Term Vision

F7-LAS aims to become a widely recognized **Agentic AI Security Framework**, complementing:

- NIST AI RMF  
- MITRE ATLAS  
- OWASP ASVS  
- MAESTRO  
- AIGN  
- AAM  

This roadmap will continue to evolve based on implementation feedback and community input.
