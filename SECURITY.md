# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security issue in the repository (schemas, examples, or documentation):

1. Do **not** open a public issue.
2. Email the maintainer directly with:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Suggested mitigation

## Supported Content

- JSON/YAML schemas  
- Policy examples  
- Documentation  
- Diagrams and architecture notes  

## Out of Scope
- Real agent code  
- Runtime implementations  
- External dependencies  
- Vendor-specific integrations  

## Responsible Disclosure
We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work to address issues promptly.
