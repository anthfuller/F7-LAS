# 1. Control Objectives

F7-LAS defines technical controls across seven layers, each derived from threats identified in the whitepaper and from weaknesses 6.1–6.3b.

## 1.1 High-Level Control Goals
- Reduce ungrounded or unsafe agent behavior.
- Enforce governance outside the model (Layer 5).
- Limit the blast radius of tool execution (Layer 6).
- Provide monitoring, explainability, and triage (Layer 7).
- Establish supply-chain integrity baselines (Layer S).
- Provide measurable safety and reliability through Service Level Objectives (SLOs).

## 1.2 Control Families
F7-LAS organizes controls under the following families:
- **SP:** System Prompt Controls  
- **RG:** Retrieval/Grounding Controls  
- **PL:** Planner & Loop Controls  
- **TL:** Tooling & Integration Controls  
- **PE:** Policy Engine Controls  
- **SE:** Sandbox/Isolation Controls  
- **ME:** Monitoring & Evaluation Controls  
- **SC:** Supply-Chain Controls (Supplemental Layer S)

Each family maps to a corresponding engineering validation item in the Engineering Review Checklist.
