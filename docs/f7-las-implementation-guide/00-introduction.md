# F7-LAS Implementation Guide v3.1 — Introduction
The F7-LAS (Fuller 7-Layer Agentic AI Security) framework provides a layered, control-centric architecture for securing agentic AI systems. This Implementation Guide translates the conceptual model from the whitepaper into concrete, deployable engineering controls aligned with modern enterprise patterns.

This guide is intended for:

- Security architects  
- AI platform teams  
- MLOps and DevOps engineers  
- Product teams building multi-agent systems  
- Governance, risk, and compliance personnel  

The goal is to operationalize F7-LAS in real production environments through:

- Control requirements  
- Implementation instructions  
- Metrics and SLOs  
- Telemetry schemas  
- RACI assignments  
- Operational playbooks  
- Supply-chain hardening  
- Model-security considerations  
- Example implementation profiles  

The guide complements the whitepaper and should be used alongside:

- Engineering Review Checklist  
- DevSecOps pipeline  
- Control Catalog  
- Reference architectures
