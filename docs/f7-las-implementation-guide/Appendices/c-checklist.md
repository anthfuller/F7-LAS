  \textbf{Note on Multi-Agent Systems} \\
  F7-LAS assumes environments in which agents may delegate tasks, escalate decision contexts,
  or issue tool calls on behalf of other agents. This multi-agent choreography introduces unique
  security and observability challenges.

  Specific controls are defined in the companion Engineering Review Checklist (items MA.1–MA.5),
  which include: delegated trust enforcement, traceability across agent boundaries, separation of duties,
  and cross-agent telemetry correlation.
