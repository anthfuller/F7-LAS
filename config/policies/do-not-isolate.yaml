  F7-LAS Layer 5 policy: assets that must NOT be automatically isolated
  by an agent, even if high risk is detected. Requires human approval.

do_not_isolate:
  - id: "prod-domain-controller-01"
    reason: "Core authentication dependency for entire org."
    owner_team: "Identity Platform"
    notes: "Isolation requires explicit CAB approval."

  - id: "core-firewall-cluster"
    reason: "Network edge; isolation could cause global outage."
    owner_team: "Network Security"
    notes: "Use policy action 'tighten_rules' instead of isolation."

  - id: "siem-main-ingestor"
    reason: "Critical for telemetry and forensics."
    owner_team: "SOC"
    notes: "Never isolate automatically; raise P1 incident instead."
